Loosely centered around the theme of translation, the initial intention for Human Sciences is to publish short essays and translation projects in process. Translation projects will be published to entwine both original and source texts in order to permit readers to view the process of translation and comment with offers of alternative translations. Human Sciences will not seek out consensus, but underscore the vast potential in translations.

Some impetus for this project might be found in the Translatorâ€™s Note, a genre of writing that too often obscures and mystifies the process of translation in order to maintain the authority of the translator.

Human Sciences seeks to publish translation projects and public scholarship in order to support transmission and exchange of ideas between scholars and the public, and to open the process through which open pedagogy can grow as a model for the humanities within and outside of the institution.
